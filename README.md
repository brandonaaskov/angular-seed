## Getting Up and Running

You'll need the following node tools installed globally (e.g. `npm install mypackage -g`)
- nvm
- bower
- gulp

```
nvm install
npm install
bower install
```

Then just `gulp` to get a build and a local server running on port 3000. 
_(If you need to change the port, you can do that in `gulpfile.js`.)_
